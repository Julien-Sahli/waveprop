## Literature

Fraunhofer and Fresnel numerical approaches come from the textbook ["Numerical Simulation of Optical 
Wave Propagation with Examples in MATLAB" (2010)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/ebooks/PM/Numerical-Simulation-of-Optical-Wave-Propagation-with-Examples-in-MATLAB/eISBN-9780819483270/10.1117/3.866274?SSO=1).

It is a very nicely-written book with code examples that are easy to follow. 

A more rigorous treatment and derivation of Fraunhofer and Fresnel approximationsn analytic 
expressions, and conditions can be found in "Introduction to Fourier Optics" by Joseph Goodman. The
referenced equations / sections in the docstrings come from the Second Edition of the book. 
Another useful resource is "Fundamentals of Photonics" by Saleh and Teich.

The Direct Integration (DI) method can be found in ["Fast-Fourier-transform based numerical 
integration method for the Rayleighâ€“Sommerfeld diffraction formula" (2006)](https://www.osapublishing.org/ao/fulltext.cfm?uri=ao-45-6-1102&id=87971).
The analytic expression for the impulse response of Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction / angular 
spectrum method can be found in Eq 7, and the expression for numerical integration can be found in 
Eq 9.
